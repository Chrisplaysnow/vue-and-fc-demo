# Vue.js and Fullcalendar.io Demo App

## Requirements
You need to have npm installed. For macOS Users: You are likely to see this (picture below) npm output when not running npm commands with sudo permission.
![Image of npm update check failed]
(/images/npm_update_check_failed.png)
In order to run future npm commands without needing sudo permission and without getting 'error' codes you should run the following command:
```
sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /Users/<Username>/.config
```
Notice that the only part of this command you should not write literally is <Username>.
